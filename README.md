# URL Shortener
## Important Note
I originally programmed this plugin for private use and made it public just for the case that anybody wants to use it. I neither guarantee that this extension works at all on your system nor do I guarantee that I will fulfill feature requests or fix any bugs that might occur. You may try to create an [issue](https://github.com/TrojanerHD/Shortener/issues) and if I have time I will maybe fix your problem or add a feature but I do not guarantee anything 
## Installation
